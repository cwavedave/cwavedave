### Hi there, I'm Dave 👋

- 🔭  -  I'm currently working on continuing my learning of Python / Django & MERN and also as important, improving my Spanish!
- 🌱  -  I'm currently learning Python, Machine Learning with Tensorflow & Django
- 🤔  -  I'm looking for help with Machine Learning & Networking in Barcelona / Remote Work Opportunities 
- 💬  -  Ask me about: Freelancing, Web Design & Development, Python
- 📫  -  How to reach me: david@creativewavelength.co.uk 
- ⚡ -  Little about me: I'm from Northern Ireland. My educational background is in Interactive Media. 
- 🏃 - Fun Fact : I'm trying to develop better habits, like running every day at 6am
- 💻 - I have been self employed now for several years, designing WordPress Websites for clients at https://creative-wavelength.com. Prior to that I worked in eCommerce & as an Analyst at a market research company. I've been a jack of all trades for a while now, being Adobe credited in Photoshop, InDesign, Flash (RIP) and Premiere. I enjoy design as much as development. I'm also Google Certified in Google Analytics! 📈 & Have managed Ad Campaigns for clients
- 🎯 - 2021 Goals - I want to build on my accreditations as much as possible & get a full time job in either Full Stack Website Development or role related to Data Analysis in Python as I find both of these niches fascinating & enjoy analysing data.
